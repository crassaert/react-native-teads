   include ':react-native-teads'
   project(':react-native-teads').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-teads/android')
   ```

## Usage

And use this where you want to use the ad view

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";
import TeadsNativeAdView from "react-native-teads";

const { width } = Dimensions.get("window");

class AdView extends Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      height: 0
    };
  }

  onDidReceiveAd = info => {
    this.setState({
      height: width / info.nativeEvent.adRatio
    });
  };

  render() {
    const { style } = this.props;

    return (
      <TeadsNativeAdView
        style={[
          {
            width,
            height: this.state.height
          },
          style
        ]}
        pid={84242}
        onDidReceiveAd={this.onDidReceiveAd}
      />
